## Introduction

Welcome to Pygame Pacman, a recreation of the classic Pacman arcade game using Python and the Pygame library. Immerse yourself in a nostalgic journey as you navigate mazes, munch on pellets, and outmaneuver ghosts in this timeless gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. Run the `pacman.py` script in your Python environment to start the game.
2. Control Pacman's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
3. Your objective is to guide Pacman to eat all the pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
4. Eating large pellets allows Pacman to temporarily eat ghosts for extra points.
5. The game ends when Pacman loses all lives or clears all the pellets.
