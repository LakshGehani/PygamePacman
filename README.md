# Pygame Pacman

Introduction:
Welcome to my Pygame Pacman game! This project aims to recreate the classic Pacman arcade experience using Python and Pygame. Immerse yourself in the nostalgic world of Pacman as you navigate through challenging mazes, gobble up pellets, and avoid the ghosts.

How to Play:
Launch the game by running the pacman.py script in your Python environment.
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control Pacman's movements.
Guide Pacman to eat all the pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
Eating large pellets will enable Pacman to temporarily eat ghosts for extra points.
The game ends when Pacman loses all lives or clears all the pellets.
